# Add project specific ProGuard rules here.
# You can find more information about ProGuard in the official documentation:
# https://www.guardsquare.com/manual/configuration/index.html

# If your project uses AAR libraries from other projects, you may have to add
# -dontwarn org.some.package.**
# to your configuration to avoid warnings from ProGuard.
